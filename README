CSE305 Project: If you're not on the ABC team, please pretend you didn't see anything.

We will use the command-line options.

First, clone it, after changing to the directory you want to the project folder to live in.
$ git clone git@github.com:zz3599/CSE305.git

Inside the directory of the cloned repo, init the upstream so you can keep track of the origin source location (zz3599)
$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/zz3599/CSE305.git
$ git fetch upstream

You now have a copy of your own. To commit to your local repository (always do this first)
$ git push origin

To submit a pull request (merge), 
Check out http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/

I will merge as needed.
